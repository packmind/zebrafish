- metric logging
- checkpoints
- mixed precision
- learning rate schedule
- figuring out image normalization ([0,1], mean/std, global or per image, etc)
- linear probe eval
- unsupervised metrics (rankme, alignment, uniformity)
- batch accuracy
- compilation
- profiling and review of pytorch performance recommendations
- re-enable syncbatchnorm once testing on gpus
- double check architectures, e.g. projection head non-linearities and norms
- consider a set_epoch function on ShardedParquetDataset, rather than relying on persistent_workers
- config + builder for augmentations
- text models and CLIP/LiT loss 
- linear probe on earlier layers
- transformer and MAE
